You are given an integer array nums. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:

Pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. Afterwards, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 and every element equal to nums[i] + 1.
Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2].
- Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 6 points.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]
Output: 9
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted. nums = [3,3].
- Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = [3].
- Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 9 points.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
1 <= nums[i] <= 104

//dynamic programming approach
class Solution {
public:
    int deleteAndEarn(vector<int>& nums) {
      int n = nums.size();
      int max1 = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());  
      vector<int> dp(20005);
      vector<int> freq(20005,0);
      for(int i : nums) freq[i]++;
      dp[0]=freq[0];
      dp[1]=freq[1];
      dp[2] = max(dp[1], 2*freq[2]);  
      for(int i=3;i<=max1;i++){
      dp[i]=max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]+i*freq[i]);    
      } 
        return dp[max1];
    }
};
